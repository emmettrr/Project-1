# Unit 7: Project 1 - Fighter Statistics website

Coding Camels: Emmett Rushin, Ted Keim, Stephen Obie, Robert George

## Overview

What is Fighter Statistics? It is a website that provides anyone interested in MMA fighters with a way to get a number of stats about each fighter. Such as age, height, weight, reach, wins, losses, etc. As well as a video related to that fighter they can not only see what the fighter looks like but also watch them fight.

Each search gets the fighter’s data from an MMA fighter database API and the fighter’s video via the YouTube API.

Currently the website works but it is more of a Proof-of-Concept to garner interest and feedback from avid MMA fans, average sports enthusiasts, and potential advertisers / investors.
